# Prediction for the spread of COVID-19 using Epidemiological Models
The purpose of the cov19 package is to integrate the differential equations of epidemiological models and fit their respective parameters with data using MCMC approach.

## 1. Getting Started
#### Dependencies
You need Python 3.7 or later to use **cov19**. You can find it at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
You also need setuptools, pandas, pygtc and tqdm packages, which is available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org). If you have pip, just run:
```
pip install pandas
pip install pygtc
pip install setuptools
pip install tqdm
```
#### Installation

You can install the package via PyPI:
```
pip install cov19
```
Alternatively, you can clone this repo to your local machine using:
```
git clone https://github.com/emdemor/cov19
```
## 2. Features
- Support for different epidemiological models
- Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) approach to fit patameters
- Data from multiple trusted and reliable sources compiled by Microsoft and accessible in www.bing.com/covid.

## 3. Results

The main result in this version is to plot de curves from the model for a specific parameter vector and compare this with dataset. In covid/stat.py, functions has been implemented to generate an MCMC sample, through which it will be possible to make inferences of the parametric intervals.
